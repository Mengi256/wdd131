        <h2>John 3:3</h2>
        <P>
         

“Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”

In this verse, Jesus teaches Nicodemus about the necessity of spiritual rebirth. Being “born again” means more than physical birth it is the process of repentance, forgiveness, and transformation through Jesus Christ. Alma 5 echoes this same idea when Alma asks, “Have ye been spiritually born of God?” Both scriptures emphasize that outward membership in the Church or simple belief is not enough.

        <h2>James 4:10</h2>
        <p>

“Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”

This verse highlights humility as the pathway to God’s power. To “humble ourselves” means recognizing our dependence on the Lord rather than relying on our own wisdom or strength. In Alma 4, the Nephites experienced this pattern: in their suffering, they humbled themselves and turned to God, and He blessed them. But when prosperity came, pride grew, and contention arose in the Church.
